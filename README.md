# Price Elasticity Of Demand In Python

Calculating  the price elasticity of demand of a commodity using python

## Getting started 

Code provides 2 methods  to calculate the price elasticity of demand:

* Simples method 
* Midpoint method 

Use whichever is preferred  

Run Jupiter note book to generate model  (run each block of code at a time )
Some blocks of code will prompt for user input: Provide the inputs required when prompted- these are the  variables of the before and quantity as well as before and after price
Final Output will provide  a  solution to the price elasticity based on inputs provided

## Prerequites
Jupyter notebook  

Can install it using anaconda
