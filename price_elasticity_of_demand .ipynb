    "Price Elasticity Of Demand gives is a measure of the percentage change in quantity of a good relative to the percentage change in price of that good. It is a measure of how sensitive the demand for a good is to the change in price. Elastic goods are sensitive to price change while inelastic ones are less sensitve. The measure uses percentage change in price and quantity as opposed to just the change quantity relative to change in price  as this would give value specific to the unit of measure used. The concept is good at helping companies/ The government price their goods/products and maximize profits.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 methods:\n",
    "* The simple method\n",
    "    * Method gives elasticity of a single point\n",
    "* The Midpoint method\n",
    "    * This method gives the  elasticity between two price points whether there is a price increase or decrease\n",
    "\n",
    "If the absolute value of Price Elasticity Of Demand is less than 1 (> 1), the good is inelastic\n",
    "If the absolute value of Price Elasticity Of Demand is greater than 1 (< 1), the good is inelastic\n",
    "If the absolute value of Price Elasticity Of Demand is equal to 1 (= 1), the good is unit elatic meaning perfectly responsive to changes in price (percentage  change in demanded is exactly the same  as the change in price)\n",
    "\n",
    "The more easily a shopper can substitute one product with a rising price for another, the more the price will fall â€“ be \"elastic.\" "
